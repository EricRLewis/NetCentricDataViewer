# NetCentricDataViewer
This is the web extension of the DataViewer application. Much like the java application, 
it reads in the data file and displays it on a data table and 3 graphs. The data can be manipulated and highlited with the mouse.

While the graphs do not change size, the user now has the option to change the background, foreground, 
and highlited color of each graph.

Drag the left mouse button to create a bounding box to select points on the graph or use ctrl and shift + click on the data table.

This application uses webGL to render the graphs and javascript to handle dynamic events and user input.

as before, sample data files a.csv and b.csv have been provided.
